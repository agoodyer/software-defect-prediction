# Software Defect Prediction
A Binary Classification Approach to the NASA Promise Dataset for Software Defects. 

## Project Overview

The NASA PROMISE dataset for software defects consists of a few thousand examples of software modules, their static code metrics, and a 0-1 defect/no-defect label. 

, where the features are represented by static code metrics (cyclomatic complexity, Halstead metrics, etc.), as well as a

We can formulate this as a binary classification problem:

**Input feature (x):** the 21 static code metrics from the dataset (attached below)

**Label (y):** Defect / No Defect


Rather than trying to create the best possible classifier for this dataset, we take a novel angle at this problem by looking at it from the perspective of interpretability and feature selection. We want to pose the question of ‘Which software metrics actually matter?’, to determine which are worth focusing on as an engineer.
