\section{Introduction}


In Software Engineering, static code metrics are often used as targets to define a 'quality' gate for a given module or piece of code.  
However, investing time into ensuring these metrics are met is painstaking, and many seem to be poor measures of the module's correctness. 

\noindent A well-known critique of metric-driven evaluation comes from economist Charles Goodhart, whose law states that: 

\begin{quote}
"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure". 
\end{quote}

  \noindent We seek to investigate the legitimacy of this statement as it pertains to static code metrics. Rather than aiming to create the best possible classifier for software defects, we instead aim to answer the question:

\begin{quote}
  "Which static software metrics \textit{actually} matter"?
\end{quote}


  \noindent To investigate this question, we adopt an approach centered on feature selection and model interpretability. 
  Specifically, we employ logistic regression in conjunction with L1 regularization to favour sparsity in the learned parameter, allowing us to derive an understanding of which metrics contribute meaningfully to defect prediction. 
  By favouring an interpretable sparse model, we aim to provide analytical insight into the value of these metrics.

Here, talk about the related work you encountered for your approach. Cite at least 5 references. Refer to item 2. No one has done exactly your task? Write about the most similar thing you can find. This should be around 0.25-0.5 pages.

\section{Dataset}


The NASA Promise Dataset is a collection of roughly 10,000 examples in software defect analysis. These examples consist of static code measures collected from NASA's Metrics Data Program (MDP). Data was collected from real software modules used by various NASA projects over a span of several decades. Data is partitioned into 13 different subsets according to the separate software project source and derived measures, which vary between sets. The attributes are primarily Halstead, McCabe, and Lines of Code related metrics.  

\noindent The original PROMISE repository being no longer accessible, thereforew we opted to use a GitHub mirror of the original dataset. It can be located \underline{\href{https://github.com/klainfo/NASADefectDataset}{here.}}

The second dataset used is the baseline from the GHRP dataset. It was created using the CK code metrics tool on the 6052 instances GHRP dataset. It contains the SHA to the sample code instance, 21 static code metrics, and a label (1/0) informing whether there is a defect or not for every instance.

\subsection{Preprocessing}

The original \textbf{PROMISE} dataset ($D'$) contains significant flaws including duplicate entries, empty modules, and inconsistencies that may pose challenges in training an effective classifier. As such, we opt to start from a pre-cleaned version of the dataset ($D''$) to reduce manual cleaning and deduplication efforts. $D''$ is frequently used as a common baseline across several of the referenced papers. The extent of our preprocessing is solely in converting the source \verb|.arff| files to  \verb|.csv| using a minimal python script.

The \textbf{GHPR} dataset required little preprocessing. 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item SHA column removed
  \item label seperated from static code metrics and assigned as the labels and input values respectively
  \item the labels and input values were split into an 80/20 train/test split
  \item input values are standardized
  \item \textbf{FCNN ONLY} input values transformed into tensor values
\end{enumerate}





\section{Features}

The \textbf{PROMISE} dataset is comprised of 21 static code metrics along with a binary Y/N label indicating the presence of defects. We plan to use all of the included metrics in our model.

We can formulate the model as a binary classification problem of the form: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Input Feature (x):} The 21 static code metrics.
  \item \textbf{Label (y):} Binary Defect / No-Defect Label.
\end{itemize}

See Table \underline{\ref{tab:metrics}} for a description of each of the 21 metrics.

Table~\ref{citation-guide} shows the syntax supported by the style files.
We encourage you to use the natbib styles.
You can use the command \verb|\citet| (cite in text) to get ``author (year)'' citations, like this citation to a paper by \citet{Gusfield:97}.
You can use the command \verb|\citep| (cite in parentheses) to get ``(author, year)'' citations \citep{Gusfield:97}.
You can use the command \verb|\citealp| (alternative cite without parentheses) to get ``author, year'' citations, which is useful for using citations within parentheses (e.g. \citealp{Gusfield:97}).

\subsection{References}

\nocite{Ando2005,andrew2007scalable,rasooli-tetrault-2015}

Many websites where you can find academic papers also allow you to export a bib file for citation or bib formatted entry. Copy this into the \texttt{custom.bib} and you will be able to cite the paper in the \LaTeX{}. You can remove the example entries.

\subsection{Equations}

An example equation is shown below:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:example}
  A = \pi r^2
\end{equation}

Labels for equation numbers, sections, subsections, figures and tables
are all defined with the \verb|\label{label}| command and cross references
to them are made with the \verb|\ref{label}| command.
This an example cross-reference to Equation~\ref{eq:example}. You can also write equations inline, like this: $A=\pi r^2$.
